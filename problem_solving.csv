Computer Science,Intro to Problem-Solving for CS,"To illustrate a core theoretical principle, let's consider the divide-and-conquer strategy in problem-solving, which is foundational in computer science. For instance, when sorting an array of numbers, we can use merge sort. Suppose we have an unsorted list: [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]. First, we divide the list into two halves recursively until each sublist contains a single element. Then, we merge these sublists by comparing elements and placing them in order. The process can be mathematically described with the recurrence relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n), where n is the number of elements.

Core theoretical principles suggest that an optimal solution is one where the resources used are minimized while still achieving the desired outcome (CODE1). Mathematically, this can often be formulated as a minimization problem, where we seek to minimize the function f(x) subject to certain constraints g(x) ≤ 0 (CODE2). To achieve this optimization, we follow a systematic process: first, identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in our current solution; next, apply appropriate algorithms or techniques such as greedy methods or dynamic programming to refine our approach (CODE3). This ensures that each step of the problem-solving process is scrutinized for potential improvements, leading us closer to an optimal solution.","CON,MATH,PRO",optimization_process,after_example
